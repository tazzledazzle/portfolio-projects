DESIGN DOCUMENT: Performance Benchmarking & Tuning Project
Overview:
Write benchmarks for a sample service—JMH for Java/Kotlin or pytest-benchmark for Python—collect before/after metrics, and present results with clear visuals.

Goals and Objectives:
• Show capacity to profile hotspots and optimize code paths
• Present quantitative improvements in a professional report

Scope:
• Select critical endpoint or algorithm in existing sample service
• Develop microbenchmarks covering hot loops
• Apply optimizations (algorithmic or configuration)
• Automate benchmark runs and generate reports

Architecture and Components:
• Benchmark module in codebase (e.g., src/benchmark/java/)
• Reporting script to parse JMH output into CSV
• Visualization notebook or script

Technology Stack:
• JMH 1.x for Java/Kotlin benchmarks
• pytest-benchmark for Python
• pandas and matplotlib for analysis

Data Flow and Interactions:

Developer runs ./gradlew jmh or pytest --benchmark-only

Benchmarks emit JSON results

Reporting script aggregates JSON into tabular CSV

Visualization script generates latency and throughput plots

Non-Functional Requirements:
• Benchmarks reproducible on any dev machine
• Measurement error ≤ +/- 5%

Security Considerations:
• No sensitive data in benchmarks

Deployment Strategy:
• Integrate benchmark run into CI nightly job
• Publish HTML report artifact

Testing Strategy:
• Validate benchmark stability across runs
• Flag regressions automatically

Timeline and Milestones:
Week 1: Benchmark suite for baseline
Week 2: Identify and implement optimizations
Week 3: Reporting pipeline
Week 4: Visualizations and documentation

Maintenance & Monitoring:
• Nightly CI benchmarks with regression alerts
• Quarterly review of optimization targets
