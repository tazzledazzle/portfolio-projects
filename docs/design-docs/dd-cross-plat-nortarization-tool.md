DESIGN DOCUMENT: Cross-Platform Notarization Tool Project
Overview:
Recreate macOS notarization flow as a standalone tool that automates signing and notarizing binaries across macOS versions. Package in Docker for consistent environments.

Goals and Objectives:
• Automate codesign → notarize → staple steps
• Support multiple certificate profiles and macOS SDK targets
• Reduce manual per-binary effort by ≥ 90%

Scope:
• CLI tool with subcommands: sign, notarize, staple, report
• Docker image containing Xcode CLT and appropriate tooling
• Config file specifying certificate IDs, bundle IDs, entitlements

Architecture and Components:
• Core module orchestrating subprocess calls to codesign, xcrun altool, stapler
• Config parser (YAML or JSON)
• Logging and retry logic

Technology Stack:
• Swift or Python 3.10
• Docker for containerization
• macOS SDK via Xcode Command Line Tools

Data Flow and Interactions:

User runs notary sign --config config.yml

Tool signs binary with specified certificate

Uploads to Apple Notary service

Polls notarization status, downloads stapled result

Generates summary report

Non-Functional Requirements:
• Tool execution < 60 s per binary (excluding upload wait)
• Retry transient network errors automatically

Security Considerations:
• Securely store Apple API keys via environment variables
• Validate config inputs

Deployment Strategy:
• Publish Docker image to Docker Hub
• Release CLI binary via GitHub Releases

Testing Strategy:
• Mock subprocess calls in unit tests
• Integration tests on real binary samples using GitHub Actions macos runner

Timeline and Milestones:
Week 1: Basic sign and notarize flow
Week 2: Config management and retries
Week 3: Docker packaging and tests
Week 4: Documentation and example repos

Maintenance & Monitoring:
• Monitor Apple notarization API changes
• Update Docker base image quarterly
