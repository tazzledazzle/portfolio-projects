DESIGN DOCUMENT: Open-Source Plugin Contribution Project
Overview:
Contribute to an existing Gradle or Bazel plugin by fixing a bug or adding a feature. Document the PR process from issue identification to merge.

Goals and Objectives:
• Showcase open-source collaboration skills
• Demonstrate ability to read and modify unfamiliar codebases
• Highlight code review and CI proficiency

Scope:
• Select one active plugin repository (e.g., Gradle Kotlin DSL plugin)
• Identify a good first issue or propose an enhancement
• Submit PR with tests and documentation update

Architecture and Components:
• Forked plugin repo on GitHub
• Local development branch with code changes
• CI validation via GitHub Actions

Technology Stack:
• Java/Kotlin for Gradle plugin or Starlark for Bazel
• Git, GitHub CLI
• JUnit or Spock for tests

Data Flow and Interactions:

Clone plugin repo, run tests locally

Implement fix/feature, add tests

Push branch, open PR with clear description

CI runs build/tests, reviewers comment

Address feedback, merge once approved

Non-Functional Requirements:
• All CI checks pass
• Code coverage for new feature ≥ 80%

Security Considerations:
• Avoid committing secrets in config
• Respect contributor license agreements

Deployment Strategy:
• Upon merge, plugin publishes new version via Gradle Plugin Portal or Bazel central registry

Testing Strategy:
• Local test suite and CI validation
• Manual smoke test in a sample project

Timeline and Milestones:
Week 1: Identify issue and plan changes
Week 2: Implement and test
Week 3: Submit PR and iterate on feedback
Week 4: Document contribution and reflect process

Maintenance & Monitoring:
• Track issue through close
• Announce contribution on personal blog or LinkedIn
