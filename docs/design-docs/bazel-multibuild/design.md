# Bazel Multi-Build

## Context

Polyglot build system demonstration using Bazel.

## Problem & Goals

- Multi-language builds
- Build optimization
- Dependency management
- Cross-platform support

## Constraints & Risks

- Bazel learning curve
- Build complexity
- Tool maintenance

## Architecture & Alternatives

- Bazel build system
- Java and Python targets
- Shared dependencies
- Remote caching

## Trade-offs

- Build speed vs complexity
- Flexibility vs simplicity

## Results & Metrics

- Fast incremental builds
- Cross-language dependencies
- Build optimization
- Remote caching benefits

## What I'd change next time

- Add more languages
- Better IDE integration
- Improved documentation
