DESIGN DOCUMENT: CI/CD Pipeline with Flaky-Test Detection Project
Overview:
Define a full CI/CD pipeline (GitLab CI or Jenkins) that builds code, runs tests, deploys artifacts, and automatically detects, quarantines, and reports flaky tests using custom Gradle lint extensions.

Goals and Objectives:
• Implement build → test → deploy pipeline
• Integrate flaky-test detection that marks unstable tests for quarantine
• Provide dashboards summarizing test stability trends

Scope:
• CI configuration files (.gitlab-ci.yml or Jenkinsfile)
• Flaky-test detection plugin for Gradle
• Reporting dashboard (e.g. Grafana)

Architecture and Components:
• Source code repo with pipeline definitions
• Gradle plugin module that tracks test pass/fail history in a persistent store (Redis or database)
• Quarantine mechanism: rerun flagged tests N times before marking as flaky
• Dashboard service reading historical data

Technology Stack:
• GitLab CI 14.x or Jenkins 2.x
• Gradle 8.x
• Redis for history store
• Grafana / Prometheus for visualization

Data Flow and Interactions:

CI runner checks out commit and executes ./gradlew build test

Custom plugin records individual test results to Redis

If test flakiness threshold exceeded, plugin creates JUnit artifact marking test as quarantined

Dashboards query Redis via Prometheus exporter

Non-Functional Requirements:
• CI job duration increase < 15% after plugin integration
• Accuracy ≥ 95% in identifying truly flaky tests
• Dashboard refresh rate ≤ 1 minute

Security Considerations:
• Restrict Redis access to CI network
• Sanitize any test names before storing

Deployment Strategy:
• Deploy Prometheus exporter alongside Redis
• Version pipeline config in repo
• Document runner prerequisites

Testing Strategy:
• Simulate flaky tests in sample module to validate detection
• Unit tests for plugin logic using Gradle TestKit

Timeline and Milestones:
Week 1: Basic CI pipeline
Week 2: Plugin MVP and history store
Week 3: Quarantine logic and JUnit reporting
Week 4: Dashboard integration and docs

Maintenance & Monitoring:
• Monitor false positives rate monthly
• Update plugin for Gradle API changes
