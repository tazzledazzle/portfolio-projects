DESIGN DOCUMENT: GitOps Starter Kit Project
Overview:
Provide a GitOps starter kit that uses Terraform and Kubernetes manifests to deploy portfolio apps. Include pipeline configs that sync on merge to master.

Goals and Objectives:
• Demonstrate modern GitOps workflows
• Enable one-click environment provisioning and application deployment
• Illustrate separation of concerns between infra and app code

Scope:
• infra/ repo containing Terraform modules for AWS or GCP
• apps/ repo with Kubernetes YAML and Helm charts
• GitLab CI or GitHub Actions workflows for sync

Architecture and Components:
• Terraform state in remote backend (S3/GCS)
• Argo CD or Flux configuration for continuous reconciliation
• CI pipeline to validate Terraform plan and manifest parsing

Technology Stack:
• Terraform 1.x, Kubernetes 1.25+
• Argo CD or Flux v2
• GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

Data Flow and Interactions:

Developer merges infra change → CI runs terraform plan → PR approval → apply

Apps manifest merge → Argo CD detects change → deploy to cluster

Non-Functional Requirements:
• Drift between Git and cluster < 60 s
• Terraform apply idempotent

Security Considerations:
• Use sealed secrets for sensitive Kubernetes objects
• Limit CI pipeline permissions via least-privilege tokens

Deployment Strategy:
• Bootstrap Argo CD via Terraform
• Provide CLI helper to bootstrap new apps

Testing Strategy:
• Validate Terraform with terraform validate and tflint
• Lint manifests with kubeval and helm lint

Timeline and Milestones:
Week 1: Infra modules and backend
Week 2: Argo CD bootstrap and demo app
Week 3: CI workflows and manifest validation
Week 4: Documentation and sample contributions

Maintenance & Monitoring:
• Monitor GitOps sync status via Argo CD UI
• Rotate secrets and keys semi-annually
