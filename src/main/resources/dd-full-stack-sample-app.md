DESIGN DOCUMENT: Full-Stack Sample Application Project
Overview:
Develop a full-stack sample app: React frontend consuming a Kotlin/Spring Boot or FastAPI backend. Include SQL (Postgres) and NoSQL (Redis) data validation, plus automated UI tests (Playwright/Cypress).

Goals and Objectives:
• Demonstrate proficiency across frontend, backend, and data layers
• Showcase integration of UI testing against real data sources

Scope:
• React SPA with authentication and CRUD UI
• Backend API with REST/GraphQL endpoints
• Postgres for primary data, Redis for caching
• Playwright or Cypress test suite validating UI/data sync

Architecture and Components:
• UI: React with React-Router, Axios
• Auth: JWT issued by backend
• Backend: Spring Boot or FastAPI serving JSON
• Database: Postgres, Redis cache layer
• Test: Playwright scripts in tests/ui/

Technology Stack:
• React 18, TypeScript
• Spring Boot 3.x (Kotlin) or FastAPI (Python)
• PostgreSQL 14, Redis 7
• Playwright 1.x or Cypress 10.x

Data Flow and Interactions:

User logs in via UI → POST /auth → JWT

UI requests data via GET /entity → backend reads Postgres or cache

Mutations trigger cache invalidation

Non-Functional Requirements:
• API response time < 150 ms
• UI test suite < 5 minutes total run time

Security Considerations:
• Use HTTPS for all endpoints
• Secure JWT storage (HttpOnly cookies)

Deployment Strategy:
• Docker Compose for local dev
• Kubernetes manifests or Docker Swarm for cloud

Testing Strategy:
• Unit tests for frontend components (Jest)
• Backend unit and integration tests
• Playwright end-to-end tests with CI gate

Timeline and Milestones:
Week 1: Backend endpoints and data models
Week 2: React UI skeleton and integration
Week 3: Caching layer and validation tests
Week 4: End-to-end tests and documentation

Maintenance & Monitoring:
• Monitor API error rates via Sentry
• Update dependencies monthly
